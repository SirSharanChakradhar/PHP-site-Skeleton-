  // To make sure we don't need to create the header section of the website on multiple pages, we instead create the header HTML markup in a separate file which we then attach to the top of every HTML page on our website. In this way if we need to make a small change to our header we just need to do it in one place. This is a VERY cool feature in PHP!

        <!--
        Here is the HTML login form.
        Notice that the "method" is set to "post" because the data we send is sensitive data.
        The "inputs" I decided to have in the form include username/e-mail and password. The user will be able to choose whether to login using e-mail or username.

        Also notice that using PHP, we can choose whether or not to show the login/signup form, or to show the logout form, if we are logged in or not. We do this based on SESSION variables which I explain in more detail in the login.inc.php file!
